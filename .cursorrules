# Project Rules for AI Assistants

You are operating within the `openclaw-workspace` integration repository.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Integration Harness**: This repo is the source of truth for bringing up the entire system. Do not edit submodule code directly unless specifically instructed. Instead, navigate to the submodule (`./infra` or `./agent`) and operate from there.
- **Contract Testing**: All multi-agent boundaries must be enforced via test. Write the failing test first.

## Coding Standards
- **Python**: Use `pytest`. Type hinting is mandatory (Pydantic V2).
- **Scripts**: Always run `shellcheck` when writing bash scripts.

## Knowledge Management
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the overarching system design.
- Read `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for tooling quirks, testing instructions, and environment setup.
- Read `AGENTS.md` for multi-agent interaction rules.
- If you discover a significant gap, technical debt, or missing implementation out of scope for your task, do not blindly fix it. Instead, document it in `KNOWN_DRIFT.md` and move on.

## Thread Governance
- Ensure terminal artifacts are produced and handoff ledgers are updated before concluding.
